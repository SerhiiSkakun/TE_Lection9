And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But as the riper should by time decease,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
   Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding:
   To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
